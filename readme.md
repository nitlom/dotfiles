# My dotfiles

This is just a collection of my most used dotfiles.

## Installing

Just run the supplied install-script, and you should be set!

```bash
$ ./install.sh
```

Old files are not removed, but renamed to $filename_beforedotfiles, so nothing is lost.
For now, it's just installing .zshrc, .vimrc and settings.json for vscode.
